Main Gameplay:
- should be simple because it's following a template.
- get the mockup image and then simply have the text at hard coordinate spots
- the final result should really just be the scene at the exact coordinate spots when corresponding with OBS.
- form replicants are simply:
   - match title (e.g. pool 4)
   - player A, win count
   - player B, win count
 On OBS I need a current time plugin and an uptime plugin

Pool Bracket Scene:
- Do the basic programming for setting up the pools
- We need to have six displayable pools on screen, so use the flexbox layouting or something
- The module itself should be a light version of the pool viewer
- Then we need another component that's on Storybook showing all the modules organized together

Top 6 Brackets:
- the simplest thing I can do is just having the matches be editable like a form
- so like match 1, match 2, etc.
- that should just correspond to some bracket graphics (organizing bracket graphics are tricky vertically though, but they are fixed. So maybe I can hardcode coordinates CSS wise or something

Finishing touches:
Can probably be done @ home before leaving. This should include:
- layout refinement (but take advantage of OBS for graphical assets)
- pool bracket scene: add combo indicator?
- animations? Like when a new score is made
- stinger screen
- starting soon and intro
- thanks for watching day 1
- credits
